# Releasing fordb

Releases are automated by **release-please**. You don't tag by hand or write
release notes — you write conventional commits, and merging the generated
release PR cuts the whole release.

## TL;DR

1. Land PRs on `main` with **conventional-commit** subjects (`feat:`, `fix:`,
   `chore:`, `docs:`, …). This is already the repo convention.
2. release-please keeps an open **"chore(main): release X.Y.Z"** PR that
   accumulates the changelog and the version bump.
3. When you want to ship, **merge that PR.** It bumps `package.json` +
   `CHANGELOG.md`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, publishes the GitHub Release, and the same
   run builds + attaches the installers + `SHA256SUMS`.

Bump size comes from the commits: `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, a
`!`/`BREAKING CHANGE` footer → major.

## What merging the release PR triggers

`.github/workflows/release-please.yml` (one run, on `GITHUB_TOKEN` only):

- **release-please** job — creates the tag + GitHub Release with the changelog.
- **build** job (matrix ubuntu + windows) — builds installers and uploads them
  to that release with `gh release upload` (electron-builder runs
  `--publish never`, so it never fights release-please over the release).
- **finalize** job — writes `SHA256SUMS`, plus the secret-gated AUR + winget
  steps.

## Manual fallback (`release.yml`)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` still runs on a hand-pushed `v*` tag — use it
only if release-please is unavailable. A tag created by release-please's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` does **not** trigger it (GitHub blocks that recursion), so the
two paths never double-fire.

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "fordb v0.1.1" && git push origin v0.1.1
```

On any `v*` tag it:

1. **build** (matrix: `ubuntu-latest` + `windows-latest`) — `pnpm build` then
   `electron-builder`, publishing artifacts to a **draft** GitHub Release for
   the tag:
   - `fordb-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` — Linux portable
   - `fordb_<version>_amd64.deb` — Debian/Ubuntu
   - `fordb-<version>-setup.exe` (+ `.blockmap`) — Windows NSIS installer
   - `latest.yml` / `latest-linux.yml` — updater metadata (published now,
     consumed once electron-updater is wired)
2. **finalize** (tag only) — downloads the assets, writes `SHA256SUMS`,
   uploads it, then flips the release from draft to public. Also runs the
   secret-gated AUR + winget steps (see below).

The release is a draft until `finalize` publishes it, so a half-built release
never goes public.

## Prerequisites

- Version in `package.json` matches the tag (`v0.1.1` → `"version": "0.1.1"`).
  The `deb` build needs the `author` email field — already set, don't remove.
- Tag from `main` after CI is green.
- Only `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auto-provided) is required. AUR/winget are optional
  add-ons and no-op without their secrets — a release succeeds on the default
  token alone.

## Dry run (optional, no tag)

Prove the matrix + native builds + NSIS work without cutting a release:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml            # workflow_dispatch, --publish never
gh run watch --workflow release.yml
```

Builds all three installers on both runners and uploads them as run
artifacts (no Release created, no publish).

## Optional distribution channels

All skip cleanly when their secret is unset — a release never depends on them.

### apt / dnf (Cloudsmith)

Set repo secret **`CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY`** (from a free Cloudsmith OSS account, an
API key with push rights on the `forinda/fordb` repository). Create the
repository once at [cloudsmith.io](https://cloudsmith.io) as `forinda/fordb`
(public; deb + rpm formats). With the secret set, each release pushes the
`.deb` + `.rpm` from the Linux build leg to Cloudsmith, and `apt install fordb`
/ `dnf install fordb` (see the README) track new versions. Without the secret
the push step is skipped.

### AUR (`fordb-bin`)

Set repo secret **`AUR_SSH_KEY`** (an AUR account's SSH private key, maintainer
of `fordb-bin`). On the next tagged release the PKGBUILD in
`packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` is pushed to the AUR automatically.

### winget

Set repo secret **`WINGET_TOKEN`** (a GitHub PAT with a `winget-pkgs` fork).
The step currently logs the intended submission; uncomment the `komac` line in
`release.yml` to submit `packaging/winget/*.yaml` live. Needs a maintainer PAT
and a `winget-pkgs` fork — see the commented block in the workflow.

## Verifying a release

```bash
gh release view v0.1.1 --json isDraft,assets    # isDraft=false, 7 assets
# checksum a download:
gh release download v0.1.1 --pattern '*.AppImage' --pattern 'SHA256SUMS'
grep AppImage SHA256SUMS | sha256sum -c -
```

Smoke the packaged app (native drivers must load from `app.asar.unpacked`):

```bash
chmod +x fordb-*.AppImage
./fordb-*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run   # opens the window
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Native dep fails to load in the packaged app** — check the module is
  covered by `asarUnpack` in `electron-builder.yml` (currently `**/*.node`,
  `@libsql`, `ssh2`, `cpu-features`). Highest-risk area when adding a driver.
- **`electron-builder` prunes the wrong deps** — packaging relies on
  `.npmrc` `node-linker=hoisted`; keep it.
- **deb build: "Please specify author 'email'"** — restore the `author`
  object (name + email) in `package.json`.
- **Windows NSIS path/casing errors** — run the dry run before tagging.

## In-app auto-update

Packaged **AppImage** and **Windows NSIS** installs check for updates on launch
(and via the "Check for updates" command), download in the background, and
prompt to restart — consuming the `latest*.yml` published with each release.
deb/rpm are updated by apt/dnf, not the in-app updater; dev builds no-op.

> **Unsigned Windows updates:** NSIS builds are unsigned, so electron-updater
> applies updates without signature verification. Anyone who can publish to the
> release feed could push a malicious update — the same trust boundary as the
> unsigned installer today. Code signing (and macOS notarization) is deferred to
> M8; until then this is an accepted risk.

## Deferred (not in this pipeline yet)

macOS dmg + code signing / notarization (M8), Flathub.
